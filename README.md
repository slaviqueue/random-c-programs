# random-c-programs

A set of random c programs that I write to practice my c skills.

To build and run a program, use `run.sh` script.

```
[~/dev/random-c-programs]$ ./run.sh hello-world
hello, world
```

To make things more handy, while working on a particular program, one can bind
running to some key in vim, like so:

```
:map <leader>r :! ./run.sh hello-world<cr>
```
